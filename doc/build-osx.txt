All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/piratecash/piratecash

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

2a. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

3. Build boost

Download: https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_66_0.html
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/local/boost-1.66 cxxflags="-arch x86_64" address-model=32_64 threading=multi macos-version=10.15 link=static runtime-link=static stage 
./b2
./b2 install

3.1.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install db48 openssl10 miniupnpc automake autoconf libtool kerberos5 mesa qrencode libevent
sudo port install gmp +universal

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build Piratecash:

cd piratecash/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./piratecashd --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./piratecashd -daemon # to start the Piratecash daemon.
Run
  ./piratecashd help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
